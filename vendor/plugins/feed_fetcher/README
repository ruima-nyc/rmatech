FeedFetcher
===========

FeedFetcher is a plugin to help you to locate feeds. Currently it only locates RSS feeds. 
FeedFetcher can be supplied with a URL and a RSS object will be populated from that URL,
if the URL represents either a RSS resource, or a HTML resource that contains a link
to a RSS page in head tag.

This enables you to provide a nice simple "add feed" function to any site that aggregates
RSS feeds where the user doesn't necessarily know the difference between a blog web page
and a blog feed. They can just enter either, and feed fetcher will figure it out.

Usage
=====

The main function that you'll be using is the class method get_feed_source on the FeedFetcher class.
If successful, it'll return a FeedSource object, that you can interrogate for the feed details or
the items in the current feed. If it fails, it'll throw an exception that you can use to determine
the problem and return a message to the user.

Here's the code that I use to call the feed fetcher from within my Blog model. If it works, I'm 
setting a couple of instance members on self.

begin
  result = FeedFetcher::FeedFetcher.get_feed_source(site_url)
  if result
    self.feed_url = result.url
    self.title = result.title
  end
rescue FeedFetcher::NoFeedForPageError
  @feed_error = "Sorry, we couldn't find a feed for this URL. Your blog needs to have a RSS feed facility for us to use it on Playful Bent."
rescue FeedFetcher::PageFeedError
  @feed_error = "You blog has a RSS feed, which is great. However, it doesn't work for us right now, which is less great. Sorry, this wont work."
rescue FeedFetcher::PageDoesntExistError
  @feed_error = "Are you sure you typed that right? We just tried to fetch that URL and we couldn't find anything there at all."
end
